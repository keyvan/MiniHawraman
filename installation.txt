How to Install Mini Hawraman
******************************************************************
Requirements:
1- A .NET 4.0 hosting environment (support for ASP.NET MVC 3.0 is
 not needed as assemblies are embedded).
2- A remote RavenDB server or modification of code to use an
 embedded version for free.
3- Knowdlege in .NET programming with C# and ASP.NET MVC in a
 basic level in order to modify some parts of code.

Important Note:
I've tried to simplify the installation and configuration
process as much as possible, but since this codebase is a
modified and minimized version of a bigger codebase as a
fast solution, there are some hardcoded parts that need
to be modified by hand in code or HTML design.

Database Setup:
There is a small utility in MiniHawraman.DatabaseGenerator that
can be used to generate the initial database with initial
values. Just run the tool and follow the instructions.

Application Setup:
You need to go to Web.Config and replace the appropriate
values inside brackets ([]) with your own. You need to have
a Twilio account with a number, or remove this 2-step verification
setup from the code yourself. You also need to set the connection
string.

Getting Started:
After setting up the database and application, you can
go to yoursite.com/admin to log in using "admin" as the
username and the password you entered when initializing
the database, and start using the site.
